# Delphi-Artur_Timeout
Program "Artur_Timeout" start create by 06.2020

The meaning of the program: after time has elapsed, it displays a lock screen that cannot be closed without entering the password and secret combination.
> [!NOTE]\
> The program was intended for parental control to limit the amount of time children watch cartoons or games on the computer.

#### When the lock screen is on:
*   You cannot use hotkeys (Ctrl + Alt + Del)
*   You cannot launch the task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
*   You cannot turn off the app
*   The sound on the computer turns off.

If the timer is running, the program is hidden in the tray.
You can turn it off without waiting for the timer to end, but you also need to enter a password and secret combination.
